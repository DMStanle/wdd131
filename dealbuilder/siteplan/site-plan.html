			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this site willl be to create custom deals on items inside of a store.
				For example, sometimes a store runs promotions where deals need to be a certain
				percentage off or where an item is free but still needs to be taxed. After the deal
				constructed, a QR code will be given which can be printed and taken to a cashier who can scan it and know how to charge the customer. </p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>This site is being made for my existing job at the BYUI University Store for technology salesmen.
				The site will be used by the salesmento make the deal and easily print off a QR code with the information
				needed to properly charge the customer. The information will include a title, short description of the deal,
				and what exactly to charge the customer. *Important note: The QR code may seem excessive, but the idea is that
				the cashiers will be using a handheld gun that transfers the information, but for this assignment I will not be
				going further than making a simple QR code.
			</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>There will be a searchbar where the salesmen can search from a list of products by name. When they select the desired product, they
				can then see the base price, add the product to a list, and ammend the price dynamically there. Adjustments include percentage discounts,
				tax exemptions and "free items that are still taxed at full price" Subtotals will be calulated along with total taxes, and a final total.
				A summary of the deal will be displayed too. This will all be out into a QR code that can be printed or screenshotted.
