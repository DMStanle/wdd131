			<h1>Deal Builder Site Plan</h1>
			<h2>Drew Stanley</h2>
			<h2>WDD 131-A2</h2>
			<!-- In the header above, add the name or your site, your name and class number. For example if you are in section 3 you would put WDD 131.03 -->

			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this site willl be to create custom deals on items inside of a store.
				For example, sometimes a store runs promotions where deals need to be a certain
				percentage off or where an item is free but still needs to be taxed. After the deal
				constructed, a QR code will be given which can be printed and taken to a cashier who can scan it and know how to charge the customer. </p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>This site is being made for my existing job at the BYUI University Store for technology salesmen.
				The site will be used by the salesmen to make the deal and easily print off a QR code with the information
				needed to properly charge the customer. The information will include an item name, short description of the deal such as (50% off),
				and dollar ammount to charge the customer. *Important note: The QR code may seem excessive, but the idea is that
				the cashiers will be using a handheld gun that transfers the information, but for this assignment I will not be
				going further than making a simple QR code.
			</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>There will be two dropdown menus. One with a lis of products, and one with a list of deals. When they select the desired product, they
				can then see the base price, adn when they select a deal, the specifics of that deal will apply to the toal at the bottom.
				For this assignment, only product and one deal at a time will be possible. Adjustments include percentage discounts,
				tax exemptions and "free items that are still taxed at full price. Total, a summary of the deal, and the name of the product will be displayed. 
				This will all be out into a QR code that can be printed or screenshotted.
